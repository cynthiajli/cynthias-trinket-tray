            <h2>Sonny Angel "Cilla"</h2>
            <p> “Cilla” is the name of this Sonny Angel, a part of their collab with illustrator Donna Wilson. Released in a limited
                edition series, Cilla is a cartoon mouse, matching with many other animals depicted in the same style for this
                collection. The mouse costume differs from most other mouse Sonny Angels, with smaller and thicker ears and lines to
                represent the fur. Out of the whole Donna Wilson set, I have six Sonnys, and it is my biggest goal to collect every
                single one. This is a little hard though, as “Brian” (a stylized bunny rabbit with long ears) is one of the most
                sought-after Sonny Angels. </p>
            
            <p>I really love this Sonny Angel because I am an avid mouse Sonny collector. I love the mice because they remind me of
                my boyfriend! When we first started talking, I played games with him on Discord, where his profile picture was a
                muscular mouse from Demon Slayer. Since then, I’ve always associated him with cartoony-looking mice. I think I’ve
                collected around 5 different mouse Sonny Angels at this point. </p>
            
            <p>I’ve been buying Sonny Angels for quite a long time, it’s like an addiction I can’t stop! They release cuter and
                cuter limited edition collections, and often times I find myself lining up 1-2 hours in front of a store before it
                even opens. I think I am pretty deep into the collecting community now, I’m in the Facebook Marketplace groups and I
                even meet up with people to buy and trade Sonny Angels… I’m just a girl…. </p>
            
            <p>In honor of two things I really love (Sonny Angels and my boyfriend), I’m picking a song by an artist both me and my
                boyfriend really like – Keshi. He rarely writes love songs, but here is one that is my favorite: Understand by
                Keshi. </p>
