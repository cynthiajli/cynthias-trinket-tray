                <h2>Black Stand Oil Bag</h2>
                <p> So this is the new bag I got after my mom decided to take the one I already owned… The bag is from a Korean brand
                    called Stand Oil, and I first saw it on LeSerrafim member Yunjin. She styled it super cutely with bows and
                    keychains, and it immediately became a trend. So that’s why I got a dupe. But when I lost the dupe to my mother, I
                    decided, might as well buy myself the real thing. So I found a deal on depop, and bought it used. </p>
                
                <p> I bought this bag perfectly in time to bring on my trip to Canada, which was my 2025 Spring Break trip. For two
                    boring days me and my best friend Vivien went to Montreal, exploring the city, visiting my man child of a cousin,
                    having mediocre poutine. But then the fun was when we met up with our good friends Nikhil and Patrick as well as
                    their friends in Toronto. They knew people who went to University of Toronto, so the group of us would hang around
                    all day, exploring the city, getting milk teas, and overall walking A LOT. We saw the Royal Ontario Museum, the UofT
                    campus, Chinatown and a lot more. Also great for us, the drinking age in Toronto is 19, and given that most of our
                    group was not 21 yet, it was one of our only times to go to bars together, so we went out. Every night. I think I
                    got a total of 12 hours of sleep across the 3 day,,, but that might be also because I’m a Type A planner, waking up
                    at 10 to make reservations and everything. </p>
                
                <p> I think this trip to Toronto one, brought me so much closer to my friends, and two, introduced me to so many great
                    people that I still talk to so much to this day. I’m really lucky to have an amazing circle around me, and that’s
                    something I always cherish. </p>
                
                <p> The song I chose for this bag is Beaches by beabadoobee. I know Patrick to be literally number 1 beabadoobee fan,
                    and we talk about music a lot. Beaches is one of my favorite songs by her, and I definitely had it on repeat when I
                    was on my way there. Also a funny moment, one of the friends I met (Jenn) was super drunk trying to play this song
                    on the guitar the last night I was in Canada. You’re an icon Jenn. </p>
