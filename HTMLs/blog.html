            <h2>Miffy Coin Pouch</h2>
            <p>This is the Miffy Pochi Pouch Keychain, available for $16.00 at the MoMa Design Store. The pouch is made of a rubbery
            white silicone, with screen-printed black facial features. The clasp of the pouch is made from metal and also has a
            silver keyring attached to the back of one of the ears. The closure is a classic coin purse closure, but it was adapted
            to fit the shape of Miffy’s ears, which is very clever and allows the purse to have a clean design. </p>
            
           <p> Now, I keep all my quarters in my Miffy pouch, just in case I stop by the Whitney to pick up some Inciardi prints. The
            Inciardi print vending machines just take quarters, and I have stopped by the Grand Central pop-up unprepared before, so
            now I keep around 5 dollars worth of quarters on me… just in case. The pouch holds a lot of coins, there’s no problem
            having 20+ quarters in it at once. </p>
            
           <p> Having a lot of quarters reminds me a lot of my dad; partially because all these quarters are some I stole from his
            bountiful collection. I used to collect state quarters with him, and then the America the Beautiful collection. So for
            this pouch that holds quarters that reminds me of my dad, I will select a song that also reminds me of him: Yesterday
            Once More by the Carpenters. </p>
