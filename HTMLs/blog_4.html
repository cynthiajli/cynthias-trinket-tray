            <h2>Crocheted Miffy Keychain</h2>
            <p> This miffy keychain I was also gifted at the same time as the lamp, but while the lamp reminds me more of the moment
                I got it, the miffy reminds me more of the travels I had with it. After a great year living with my best friends, I
                went on a trip to Vietnam and China with my mom and my grandparents. I had asked for a cute Miffy keychain so I
                could put it on a bag I had (almost identical to the Stand Oil bag) to really give the maximalist look. But right
                when I put the bunny on the bag, my mom walks into my room complaining about how she doesn’t have a bag to take to
                China. I offer my new bag that I just got, and she takes it for the trip. Clearly, as the bag is going through
                international travel, it’s going through A LOT. TSA check, being on a plane, being set down on random surfaces. So
                the longer my mom uses my bag, the dirtier and dirtier Miffy gets. From what used to be a pristine white rabbit, its
                now browned from the miles I’ve taken her with me. </p>
            
            <p>When I returned from China, my mom still wanted to use the bag, even though it was MY BAG. So being the amazing
                loving daughter I am (and to give me an excuse to buy a new bag) I let her keep using it. She takes off the keychain
                so I can use it, but I put off buying a new bag for at least a few months. So little miffy is tumbling around in the
                pocket of my backpack for a few months… and by the time I get my new Stand Oil Bag, she’s seen quite a few things.
                But I still love her. </p>
            
            <p>The song I chose is ROCKSTAR by LISA, both because Jasmine (who gifted this to me) LOVES her, but also this song came
                out around the time I went on my trip, so I’m sure I listened to it on repeat. I can’t remember, that trip felt like
                a fever dream. </p>
