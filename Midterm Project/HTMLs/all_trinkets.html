            <p>
                This is the Miffy Pochi Pouch Keychain, available for $16.00 at the MoMa Design Store. The pouch is made of a rubbery
                white silicone, with screen-printed black facial features. The clasp of the pouch is made from metal and also has a
                silver keyring attached to the back of one of the ears. The closure is a classic coin purse closure, but it was adapted
                to fit the shape of Miffy’s ears, which is very clever and allows the purse to have a clean design...

        </a>
            <p> “Cilla” is the name of this Sonny Angel, a part of their collab with illustrator Donna Wilson. Released in a limited
                edition series, Cilla is a cartoon mouse, matching with many other animals depicted in the same style for this
                collection. The mouse costume differs from most other mouse Sonny Angels, with smaller and thicker ears and lines to
                represent the fur. Out of the whole Donna Wilson set, I have six Sonnys, and it is my biggest goal to collect every
                single one. This is a little hard though, as “Brian” (a stylized bunny rabbit with long ears) is one of the most
                sought-after Sonny Angels. </p>

                This Miffy Lamp is one of three sizes, and is the smallest one. It is battery operated, and turns on for 15 minutes at a time; then 
                it automatically shuts off. I was given this lamp by my roommates and close friends for my 20th birthday, along with other little 
                bits and bobs that I like. I'm always reminded of how amazing my friends are, and how much I miss them, now that we don't live
                together anymore.

            </a>
        <p> This is a small figurine of Kirby sitting atop a star. The figurine is flocked, so the entire thing is a little bit
            soft and fuzzy. It’s quite small, smaller than a lot of figurines I have, but also quite hefty in weight for its
            size. The box it came in wasn’t exactly a blind box: there’s a window where you can peek in and see what is inside,
            but there are around 10 options for what to pull. A lot of them are Kirby in various poses, but some are other
            characters from the game. </p>

            I clearly love Miffy a lot! I was gifted this on the same birthday as I was given the Miffy lamp. I had wanted a charm 
            to go on a bag I had bought, and expressed that a Miffy charm would be super cute. I'm so lucky that I was surprised
            with one for my birthday! I think it goes amazingly with my bag, and it's already a little dirty from all the love 
            it's been given.
