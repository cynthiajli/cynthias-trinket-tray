Cynthia's Trinket Tray! 

This is my HTML blog where I rate various figurines, keychains, dolls, and other trinkets I buy, hence my "Trinket Tray". The Trinket Tray is a place I can log information about items, share personal memories, and even reccomend music. I think the collector community has been really amazing to me and supportive, I've created this page to recreate the collaborative nature of collecting, but also as a diary to show a human aspect to this consumerism. 

Sample blog pages are created only for "Miffy Coin Pouch", "Sonny Angel "Cilla"", and "Kirby Star Figurine". The contact form is a functioning form.
