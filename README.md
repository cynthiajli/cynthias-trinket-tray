Cynthia's Trinket Tray! 

This is my HTML blog where I rate various figurines, keychains, dolls, and other trinkets I buy, hence my "Trinket Tray". The Trinket Tray is a place I can log information about items, share personal memories, and even reccomend music. I think the collector community has been really amazing to me and supportive, I've created this page to recreate the collaborative nature of collecting, but also as a diary to show a human aspect to this consumerism. 

UPDATES FOR THE FINAL PROJECT: 
Firstly, I added a draggable function for the items on the home page, making it fel more like a physical trainket tray where things can stack on top of eachother. 
I also added a wishlist function, where a user can click on a button for items in my collection they want to add to a wishlist, and when you click the "See my Wishlist" button, displays a list of recorded items on another page.

The contact form is a functioning form.
