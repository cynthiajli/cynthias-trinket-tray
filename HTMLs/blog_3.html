                <h2>Portable Miffy Lamp</h2>
                <p>This Miffy Lamp is one of three sizes, and is the smallest one. It is battery operated, and turns on for 15 minutes
                    at a time; then it automatically shuts off. The largest size of the lamp is a few feet tall, and is one of my holy
                    grail home decor items, it just happens to also be hundreds of dollars and I don’t know if I am willing to pay
                    that….</p>
                
                <p>I was given this lamp by my roommates and close friends for my 20th birthday, along with other little bits and bobs
                    that I like. I was actually super touched because while I mention things I want all the time, this was something I
                    was never expecting to receive. My best friends at the time (roommate Jasmine and our bestie Cesar) went to the MoMa
                    Design store to pick it up the day of my birthday dinner. And when I came back from dinner, I opened the door to see
                    a whole spread of things waiting for me, including a crazy amount of Sonny Angels. I'm always reminded of how
                    amazing my friends are and how much I miss them, now that we don't live together anymore.</p>
                
                <p>Jasmine moved out of the dorms this year, and Cesar has been studying abroad in Italy. And even when the three of us
                    are together, nothing will ever live up to us living directly across the hall from each other (totally by
                    coincidence if you can believe it). I think I didn’t really appreciate the arrangement we were blessed with; every
                    day I had at least five people over to have dinner, talk, and just act dumb together. It almost felt like having a
                    family, everyone was just a few steps away. </p>
                
                <p>The song I chose for this trinket is Bongos by Megan thee Stallion. Cesar was a HUGE Megan fan, and Bongos had just
                    come out a few months into the year. I remember he would walk into me and Jasmine’s room and yell “ALEXA PLAY
                    BONGOS” to get us up and ready for the day. I think those might be some of my fondest memories at NYU.</p>
