            <h2>Kirby on a Star Figurine</h2>
            <p> This is a small figurine of Kirby sitting atop a star. The figurine is flocked, so the entire thing is a little bit
                soft and fuzzy. It’s quite small, smaller than a lot of figurines I have, but also quite hefty in weight for its
                size. The box it came in wasn’t exactly a blind box: there’s a window where you can peek in and see what is inside,
                but there are around 10 options for what to pull. A lot of them are Kirby in various poses, but some are other
                characters from the game. </p>
            
            <p>This figurine was gifted to me as a party favor from one of my close friends Nikhil for attending his birthday party.
                He selected different figurines to match the personality of his friends who were at the party, and I was very happy
                with the Kirby that I received! Being one of the first things I’ve received from him, I cherish this little Kirby
                figurine a lot. And as I’ve become better friends with more people who were there, it warms my heart a bit to know
                that everyone is united by these small figurines as a physical reminder of our shared experience. </p>
            
            <p>Nikhil is a very big fan of the K-pop group TWICE, and I am also a pretty big K-pop fan, so we listen to a lot of
                TWICE together. When I think back to that day, I can remember us playing a Kahoot where we were quizzed on the
                members of TWICE (a quiz that many other party-goers failed). To commemorate that day and our ever-growing
                friendship, the song I am selecting to go with this cute Kirby is: Rewind by TWICE. </p>
